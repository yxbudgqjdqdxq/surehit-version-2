      <h1>The Exception—How You Changed the Rules</h1>
      <p>I have never easily fallen for someone; relationships were never the path I wanted to wander. You became the exception because you challenged my assumptions with small things—consistency, attention, a single act that proved you when it mattered. I’ll say it clearly: being an exception is earned, not declared. You didn’t make loud declarations. You earned it by being present in ways that didn’t require applause. That changed how I evaluate value: not through grand promises, but through the everyday honesty of presence. If you are sincere, I will respond in kind—measured, composed, and without lowering my standards.</p>
