      <h1>Her Understanding</h1>
      <p>Understanding isn’t sympathy dressed up as action. It’s noticing the pattern behind a face, remembering the small contradictions, and showing up with awareness. You have met pieces of my past—the facts I can speak about and the scars I don’t show. When you read between the lines and respond without drama, that tells me you can carry the parts of me I struggle with. Your ability to sit with my contradictions without trying to change me is rare. That steadiness is what I look for. If you have it, you pass the quiet part of the test: the part that determines whether two people can create something that lasts.</p>
