      <h1>Gratitude Without Performance</h1>
      <p>I appreciate what you do, and I will express that clearly. My appreciation isn’t pressure for you to respond in kind; it’s recognition. I won’t dramatize my thanks to manipulate your loyalty, nor will I accept empty gestures pretending to be affection. True gratitude is a quiet entry in a ledger: noted, valued, and stored. This allows both of us to move with dignity. If you need recognition, ask for it directly. If you give without expecting anything back, I will honor that by holding my ground and allowing you space to be recognized in return.</p>
