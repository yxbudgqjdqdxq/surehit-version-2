      <h1>Boundaries That Protect What Matters</h1>
      <p>Boundaries aren’t walls; they’re the lines that keep what matters safe. I have boundaries—about respect, honesty, and how I spend my time—because I value the person I bring into a relationship. I won’t accept manipulation disguised as affection. I will name things as they are and keep the terms clear. That firmness isn’t punishment; it’s responsible management. If you respect my limits, I will respect yours. This mutual understanding creates safety, and safety, more than drama, is where trust grows.</p>
