      <p>Grand gestures are easy to fake. The true signs lie in the small moments: remembering a detail you mentioned in passing, making tea when you’re tired, standing up for you when no one else is around. Those small actions are how I assess intention. Gifts and apologies are like windows—small and revealing—that let me check if your heart matches your words. I’ve learned to value substance over showiness. If you care enough to do the simple things well, I will pay attention, keep track, and respond with the kind of steadiness that supports rather than clings.</p>
