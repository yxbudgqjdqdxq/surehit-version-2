      <h1>In Search of the Real Her</h1>
      <p>I grew up learning that affection can be conditional and attention can be easily withdrawn. Sometimes my parents showed affection, and sometimes they didn’t. That uncertainty taught me to read rooms, to take notes, and to protect myself with silence. So when you gave me something handcrafted, with time, thought, and messy sincerity, it hit where words never could. It proved you made a choice. Not because I need gifts, but because I learned to expect gestures to be performative. Your hands created something real. That reality changed me quietly; it softened some of the guard I keep for good reason. I will not beg for warmth; I will recognize and value it when it comes.</p>
