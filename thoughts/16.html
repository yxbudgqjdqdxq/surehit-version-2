      <h1>Time, Tests, and the Measure of Care</h1>
      <p>Time reveals what’s important. Tests aren’t traps, but tools—how you act when you’re tired, busy, or bored shows the true nature of your heart. I offer patience where there’s growth; I withdraw support when patterns repeat without change. Caring shows across seasons—not just in the heat of excitement. I measure care through consistent actions, in the willingness to be inconvenienced for someone else’s benefit. If you invest in small, constant improvements instead of grand speeches, you will find me equally invested and steady.</p>
