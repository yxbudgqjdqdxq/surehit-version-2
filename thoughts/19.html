      <h1>The Future I Build Doesn’t Happen by Accident</h1>
      <p>I don’t picture a future with someone just because things feel good now. I’ve learned that connection only works when both people take care of it. If you’re beside me later in life, it won’t be due to chance or chemistry; it’ll be because we both respected what truly matters.  
I know how to keep a relationship stable: clarity, effort, and respect that doesn’t fade when emotions run high. I’ve seen enough chaos to recognize what breaks people, and enough growth to see what keeps things strong. If you stay consistent, if you don’t sabotage what we build, you’ll always have a spot in my future. This isn’t about being dependent on you; it’s about you proving you can keep pace with me.  
I’m not here to repeat past mistakes. I want to move forward with someone who understands that real relationships are built on decisions, not excuses. If you do your part, I’ll do mine. If you start drifting, I won’t pull you back. My future is set; the question is if you can join me without losing yourself or me.</p>
