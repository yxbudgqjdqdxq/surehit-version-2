      <h1>Safety in My Vulnerability — Not Weakness</h1>
      <p>I’ve cared too hard for people who didn’t deserve it. I’ve given loyalty where it wasn’t matched, opened doors for people who walked in just to take what they wanted. So now, when I show someone the personal parts of my life, it isn’t softness—it’s a filtered decision. I don’t hand out access for free anymore.
If I talk about my past, my mistakes, or the things that actually shaped me, it’s because you’ve shown enough consistency for me to test how you handle it. I’m not looking for comfort or pity. I’m checking whether you’re someone who can respect what I choose to reveal.
If you respond with steadiness, I take note. If you turn emotional honesty into drama, guilt, or ego, I shut the door and don’t open it again.
My vulnerability isn’t an invitation; it’s a checkpoint. Passing it means you know how to treat what matters. Failing it means you weren’t built for the real version of me. I’ve learned this lesson too many times to pretend otherwise.</p>
